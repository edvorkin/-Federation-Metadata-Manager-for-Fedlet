Documentation
-------------
This script is intended to automate membership configuration of an OpenSSO 
(Oracle or OpenFM) Fedlet in a Shibboleth Federation. In fact Fedlets is not able to handle
metadata with more than one EntityDescriptor element. A workaround to this
limit is to download the metadata, split it for each member, create the

circle of trust file - fedlet.cot file.
Script also generates json file if you want to use Embedded Discovery Service.


First of all, customize the context-based variables at the beginning of femma.py:

example:
	c:\python25\python.exe femmo.py -m https://www.idem.garr.it/docs/conf/signed-metadata.xml
     

The script creates 1 directory with metadata files.

Then you need to copy generated files into your fedlet home directory:
